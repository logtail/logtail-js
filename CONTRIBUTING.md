# Contributing

We are using `yarn` to manage dependencies.

1. `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn bootstrap` to install and cross-link packages in `packages/*`
3. To run tests
   1. Run `yarn test` to run all tests
   2. To run tests for a single package use `yarn test packages/node` to run tests only from the node package for example
4. Run `yarn build` to build all packages
